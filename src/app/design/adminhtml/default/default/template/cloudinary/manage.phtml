        Foldered migration: <strong><?php echo $this->isFolderedMigration() ? "Enabled" : "Disabled" ?> </strong><br>

        Foldered migration now available! (don't start migration if you want foldered migration before doing the below tasks) <br> <br>
        To set up foldered migration you need to: <br> <br>

         - <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload">https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload</a>
        and set 'Auto-create folders' - Enabled <br>

         - <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload">https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload</a>
        and set 'Use file name in Media Library' - Yes <br>

         - <a href="<?php echo $this->getUrl('adminhtml/system_config/edit/section/cloudinary'); ?>"><?php echo $this->__('Go to the Cloudinary configuration section'); ?></a>
         and set 'Migrate images to folders relative to the magento root folder' - Yes <br>
        <br>

        If you already use simple migration, you will have deprecated information which you can fold: <br>
         - `cloudinary_synchronisation` table entries (you can wipe the table clean before starting foldered migration) <br>
         - all previously migrated images to cloudinary are not touched and will remain in the unfoldered structure
        (they all are in the cloudinary root folder and can be erased safely, since all images migrated with folders
        will take place in the /media/... folder) <br> <br> <br>
        </p>

    </p>
    <?php if ($this->allImagesSynced()): ?>
        <div id="messages"><ul class="messages"><li class="notice-msg"><ul><li><span>All images have been successfully migrated to Cloudinary</span></li></ul></li></ul></div>
    <?php else: ?>
        <p>Image migration progress: <?php echo floor($this->getPercentComplete()) ?>%</p>
        <p><?php echo $this->getSynchronizedImageCount() ?> of <?php echo $this->getTotalImageCount() ?> images migrated to Cloudinary.</p>
    <?php endif; ?>

    <div class="migration_errors">

        <?php

            $errors = $this->getErrors();
            $count = sizeof($errors);
            echo "<div><strong>ERRORS ($count):</strong> (re-occuring errors refresh their timestamp)</div>";
            echo $this->getClearErrorsButton();

            foreach ($errors as $error){
                $message = $error->getMessage();
                $filePath = $error->getFilePath();
                $timestamp = $error->getTimestamp();
                echo "<div class=\"migration_error\">$filePath: $message ($timestamp)</div>";
            }
        ?>
    </div>
</p>

    <strong>
        Note: If you have a lot of images (thousands or more), image migration may take a while.
        You can leave this page and come back to check on progress while the migration is performed in the background.
